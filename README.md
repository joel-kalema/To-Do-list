## Getting Started

<h1>webpack</h1>
  <p>
    Webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.

<h2 align="center">Install</h2>

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack
```

Install with yarn:

```bash
yarn add webpack --dev
```

### Get Started

Check out webpack's quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).

### Browser Compatibility

Webpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).
Webpack also needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to [load a polyfill](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) before using these expressions.
